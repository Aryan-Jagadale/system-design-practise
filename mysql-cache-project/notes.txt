Key Learning Areas
1. Caching Strategies
Implementation of caching layer between application and MySQL database
Understanding when and how to cache data effectively
Cache invalidation patterns and strategies
2. Performance Optimization
Load Testing (load-test.js) - Measuring system performance under load
Comparing performance with and without caching
Understanding bottlenecks in database operations
3. Database Integration
MySQL database connectivity and operations
Handling database queries efficiently
Understanding the cost of database round trips
4. Containerization with Docker
Docker Compose setup for multi-service architecture
Running MySQL and application in containers
Service orchestration and networking
5. System Design Concepts
Cache-aside pattern (likely implemented in cache.js)
Read-through/Write-through caching
Understanding trade-offs between consistency and performance
6. Testing and Benchmarking
Load testing implementation
Performance metrics collection
Comparing cached vs non-cached performance
7. Real-world Architecture Patterns
Typical web application stack (App → Cache → Database)
Scalability considerations
Memory management for caching
Expected Performance Improvements
Reduced database load
Faster response times for frequently accessed data
Better system scalability under high load
